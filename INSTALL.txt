The installer, if there is one, creates a shortcut on the desktop.
It starts a batch file that starts Joy.

Just in case the batch file fails to execute, maybe because Windows is running
in S-mode or maybe the Windows version is very old, here is the manual
procedure that can be followed to start the G3 application:

- First of all, a language file needs to be copied to the working directory.
  The language files are located in the installation directory, in the
  subdirectory `G3/lang`. One of them needs to be copied to the working
  directory and renamed to `lang.joy`.

- The second task is to create a shortcut to the Joy binary, possibly in the
  working directory and maybe on the desktop. The command line in the shortcut
  should call `joy.exe` with parameter `g3.joy`. The last one uses a path
  relative to the installation directory. It is there that `g3.joy` is located.
  The working directory in the shortcut should point to the directory where
  `lang.joy` is located.

There is no option from within Joy to restart the executable with a different
command line. That would be just as cumbersome as creating a shortcut and needs
to be repeated every time that Joy is started.

So, if the shortcut fails to execute, this manual procedure is the only way to
access the G3 application. It needs to be followed only once.
